            Japanese, or 日本語  (nihongo) is the national language of Japan. It’s not spoken natively anywhere else. The use of the language is becoming more widespread however, due to the penetration of popular Japanese culture. As a result, more and more people have become interested in learning Japanese.
          </p>

          <p>
           There are a number of theories about the origins of Japanese, but the strongest arguments for affiliation are with Korean, on the basis of similar syntax, and with Altaic languages, on the basis of similar number systems and verb forms. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Japanese vocabulary consists of 49% words of Chinese origin, 33% words of Japanese origin, and 18% loanwords from other languages, which include European languages, words of mixed origin and the made-in-Japan pseudo-English known as wasei eigo.

          <p>The Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (日本語能力試験, Nihongo Nōryoku Shiken), or JLPT, is a standardized criterion-referenced test to evaluate and certify Japanese language proficiency for non-native speakers, covering language knowledge, reading ability, and listening ability. The test is held twice a year in Japan and selected countries (on the first Sunday of July and December), and once a year in other regions (on the first Sunday of December).</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Test takers who pass JLPT N1 receive 15 points, and who pass JLPT N2 receive 10 points under the government's "Point-based Preferential Immigration Treatment System for Highly Skilled Foreign Professionals." Individuals with a total of 70 points or higher receive preferential treatment at immigration.
            </li>
            <li>N1 is a prerequisite for foreign medical professionals who wish to take examinations to be licensed in Japan, and for certain foreign nationals who wish to attend nursing school in Japan.</li>
            <li>
              Those who have passed either N1 or N2 (regardless of citizenship) are exempt from the Japanese language section of the middle school equivalency examination, which is required in order to enter a Japanese high school if the applicant did not graduate from a Japanese middle school.

Foreign Service Institute language difficulty rankings are an indication of how long a native English speaker would need to reach proficiency in a number of different languages.
            </p>
            <p>
            There are five categories, ranked from easiest to the hardest based on how many classroom hours a learner would need to reach professional working proficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
            Japanese is a category V language, which are exceptionally difficult for native English speakers. Additionally, Japanese is notated as more difficult than other languages in the same category.

        <p>
          There are a total of three writing systems in Japanese. Hiragana, katakana, and kanji.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kanji characters came from the Chinese writing system. The kanji might be identical to its traditional or simplified Chinese counterpart, or it may be neither.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hiragana is the most ‘basic’ of the three writing systems. It’s used for words without kanji, or words that are no longer written in kanji.
        </p>
        <p>
          Katakana is used primarily for words of foreign origin. Words are also purposely written in katakana at times in order to create emphasis, in a somewhat similar way to when bolds are typed in ALL CAPS in English, but for creating a different effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, which is which? Kanji characters (e.g. 日本語学) are generally more complex, with way more strokes then hiragana (e.g. なにぬねの) and katakana (e.g. ナニヌネノ). Among the two, hiragana is the more curly script, while katakana is more angular and blocky (and generally looks more simplified).
        </p>
        </article>

      <section class="main-section" id="Kanji">
        <header>Kanji</header>
        <article>
         
          <p>
         Kanji (漢字) are the logographic Chinese characters taken from the Chinese script and used in the writing of Japanese. They were made a major part of the Japanese writing system during the time of Old Japanese and are still used, along with the subsequently-derived syllabic scripts of hiragana and katakana. The characters have Japanese pronunciations; most have two, with one based on the Chinese sound. A few characters were invented in Japan by constructing character components derived from other Chinese characters. After World War II, Japan made its own efforts to simplify the characters, now known as shinjitai, by a process similar to China's simplification efforts, with the intention to increase literacy among the common folk. Since the 1920s, the Japanese government has published character lists periodically to help direct the education of its citizenry through the myriad Chinese characters that exist. There are nearly 3,000 kanji used in Japanese names and in common communication.
          </p>
          <p>
           The term kanji in Japanese literally means "Han characters". It is written in Japanese by using the same characters as in traditional Chinese, and both refer to the character writing system known in Chinese as hanzi (traditional Chinese: 漢字; simplified Chinese: 汉字; pinyin: hànzì). The significant use of Chinese characters in Japan first began to take hold around the 5th century AD and has since made a profound influence in shaping Japanese culture, language, literature, history, and records. Inkstone artifacts at archaeological sites dating back to the earlier Yayoi period were also found to contain Chinese characters.
          </p>
          <p>
           Although some characters, as used in Japanese and Chinese, have similar meanings and pronunciations, others have meanings or pronunciations that are unique to one language or the other. For example, 誠 means 'honest' in both languages but is pronounced makoto or sei in Japanese, and chéng in Standard Mandarin Chinese. Individual kanji characters invented in Japan, or multi-kanji words coined in Japanese, have also influenced and been borrowed into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese in recent times. For example, the word for telephone, 電話 denwa in Japanese, is calqued as diànhuà in Mandarin Chinese, điện thoại in Vietnamese and 전화 jeonhwa in Korean.

          <p>
            Hiragana (平仮名, ひらがな)is a Japanese syllabary, part of the Japanese writing system, along with katakana as well as kanji.

It is a phonetic lettering system. The word hiragana literally means "flowing" or "simple" kana ("simple" originally as contrasted with kanji).
          </p>
           <p>
            Hiragana and katakana are both kana systems. With few exceptions, each mora in the Japanese language is represented by one character (or one digraph) in each system. This may be either a vowel such as "a" (hiragana あ); a consonant followed by a vowel such as "ka" (か); or "n" (ん), a nasal sonorant which, depending on the context, sounds either like English m, n or ng when syllable-final or like the nasal vowels of French, Portuguese or Polish. Because the characters of the kana do not represent single consonants (except in the case of ん "n"), the kana are referred to as syllabic symbols and not alphabetic letters.
          </p>
           <p>
            Hiragana is used to write okurigana (kana suffixes following a kanji root, for example to inflect verbs and adjectives), various grammatical and function words including particles, as well as miscellaneous other native words for which there are no kanji or whose kanji form is obscure or too formal for the writing purpose. Words that do have common kanji renditions may also sometimes be written instead in hiragana, according to an individual author's preference, for example to impart an informal feel. Hiragana is also used to write furigana, a reading aid that shows the pronunciation of kanji characters.

        <article>
          <p>
            Katakana (片仮名、カタカナ) is a Japanese syllabary, one component of the Japanese writing system along with hiragana, kanji and in some cases the Latin script (known as rōmaji). The word katakana means "fragmentary kana", as the katakana characters are derived from components or fragments of more complex kanji. Katakana and hiragana are both kana systems. With one or two minor exceptions, each syllable (strictly mora) in the Japanese language is represented by one character or kana in each system. Each kana represents either a vowel such as "a" (katakana ア); a consonant followed by a vowel such as "ka" (katakana カ); or "n" (katakana ン), a nasal sonorant which, depending on the context, sounds either like English m, n or ng or like the nasal vowels of Portuguese or Galician.
          </p>

          <p>
            In contrast to the hiragana syllabary, which is used for Japanese words not covered by kanji and for grammatical inflections, the katakana syllabary usage is comparable to italics in English; specifically, it is used for transcription of foreign-language words into Japanese and the writing of loan words (collectively gairaigo); for emphasis; to represent onomatopoeia; for technical and scientific terms; and for names of plants, animals, minerals and often Japanese companies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Katakana was originally created by Japanese Buddhist monks in order to better transliterate Indian texts and works of art transmitted directly from India (such as Bodhisena) or through Buddhism via China. It is strongly influenced by both Indian and Chinese linguistic customs.

          <p>Of course, the grammar of an entire language is far too complicated to be explained in a single paragraph. I’ll just highlight some key features here.
            </p>
          <p>
           <b>Sentence structure</b>
          </p>

<ul>
            <li>Japanese sentence structure is classified as a subject-object-verb. Meaning that verbs are typically placed at the end of a sentence. In contrast, English has a subject-verb-object order.</li>
            <li>However, in Japanese, the subject AND object can be dropped as long as the context is clear. That means that a single verb can be a grammatically correct, complete, sentence.</li>
            <li>The word order is flexible too, so long as the verb stays at the end, you can rearrange the subject and object without affecting the meaning of the sentence.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <p>
          <b>Particles</b>
          </p>
<ul>
  <li>Particles rather than word order is used to indicate which is the subject, and which is the object. This explains why the sentence order is so flexible.</li>
</ul>
          <p>
        <b>Tenses</b>
          </p>
<ul>
  <li>Like in English, past and present tenses are used.</li>
</ul>
          <p>
        <b>Numbers</b>
          </p>
<ul>
  <li>Unlike English, there’s no indication of singular or plural in Japanese nouns.</li>
</ul>


   <p>
        <b>Articles</b>
          </p>
<ul>
  <li>There are no articles in Japanese. No ‘a’, ‘an’ or ‘the’.</li>
</ul>

   <p>
        <b>Conjugation of Verbs</b>
          </p>
<ul>
  <li>There are various ways a single verb can be conjugated. The conjugation is used to indicate various concepts, including tenses, and negative (or positive).</li>
</ul>

Arguably the most important component of Japanese proficiency is vocabulary. Building your vocab will help you understand more, which will let you get more from what you read and listen to, and help you engage in more situations where you can communicate, which creates a virtuous circle of improvement.

            If you are not an Asian, Japanese can sound pretty strange and hard to catch at first. But there’s good news! Although it’s been classified as being the hardest language to learn together with Chinese and Korean, it’s certainly not the hardest of those three. Unlike Chinese which has four tones for every word, tones play a way less important role in Japanese. There are certainly similarities in the sounds of these three languages though.
          </p>
          <p>For those from Asian countries, Japanese might be easier for you. In particular, those who know mandarin hanyu pinyin would find that the Japanese pronunciation system is very similar.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Dialects">
        <header>Dialects</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The dialects of the Japanese language fall into two primary clades, Eastern (including Tokyo) and Western (including Kyoto), with the dialects of Kyushu and Hachijō Island often distinguished as additional branches, the latter perhaps the most divergent of all. The Ryukyuan languages of Okinawa Prefecture and the southern islands of Kagoshima Prefecture form a separate branch of the Japonic family, and are not Japanese dialects, although they are sometimes referred to as such.
          </p>
          <p>
Regional variants of Japanese have been confirmed since the Old Japanese era. Man'yōshū, the oldest existing collection of Japanese poetry, includes poems written in dialects of the capital (Nara) and eastern Japan, but other dialects were not recorded. The recorded features of eastern dialects were rarely inherited by modern dialects, except for a few language islands such as Hachijo Island. In the Early Middle Japanese era, there were only vague records such as "rural dialects are crude". However, since the Late Middle Japanese era, features of regional dialects had been recorded in some books, for example Arte da Lingoa de Iapam, and the recorded features were fairly similar to modern dialects. The variety of Japanese dialects developed markedly during the Early Modern Japanese era (Edo period) because many feudal lords restricted the movement of people to and from other fiefs. Some isoglosses agree with old borders of han, especially in Tohoku and Kyushu. From the Nara period to the Edo period, the dialect of Kinai (now central Kansai) had been the de facto standard form of Japanese, and the dialect of Edo (now Tokyo) took over in the late Edo period.
          </p>
          <p>
With modernization in the late 19th century, the government and the intellectuals promoted establishment and spread of the standard language. The regional languages and dialects were slighted and suppressed, and so, locals had a sense of inferiority about their "bad" and "shameful" languages. The language of instruction was Standard Japanese, and some teachers administered punishments for using non-standard languages, particularly in the Okinawa and Tohoku regions. From the 1940s to the 1960s, the period of Shōwa nationalism and the post-war economic miracle, the push for the replacement of regional varieties with Standard Japanese reached its peak.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now Standard Japanese has spread throughout the nation, and traditional regional varieties are declining because of education, television, expansion of traffic, urban concentration etc. However, regional varieties have not been completely replaced with Standard Japanese. The spread of Standard Japanese means the regional varieties are now valued as "nostalgic", "heart-warming" and markers of "precious local identity", and many speakers of regional dialects have gradually overcome their sense of inferiority regarding their natural way of speaking. The contact between regional varieties and Standard Japanese creates new regional speech forms among young people, such as Okinawan Japanese.

       The culture of Japan has changed greatly over the millennia, from the country's prehistoric Jōmon period, to its contemporary modern culture, which absorbs influences from Asia and other regions of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
The ancestry of Japanese people remains mysterious; however, there are two competing hypotheses that try to explain the lineage of the Japanese people.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The first hypothesis proposes a dual-structure model, in which Japanese populations are descendants of the indigenous Jomon people and later arrivals of people from the East Eurasian continent, known as the Yayoi people. Japan's indigenous culture originates primarily from the Yayoi people who settled in Japan between 1000 BCE and 300 CE. Yayoi culture spread to the main island of Honshū, mixing with the native Jōmon culture. Modern Japanese have an estimated 80% Yayoi and 20% Jōmon ancestry.[</li>
            <li>The second hypothesis posits a tripartite model of genomic origin. This hypothesis proposes that contemporary Japanese people are from three distinct ancestral groups: Jomon, Yayoi and Kofun, with 13%, 16% and 71% of genetic ancestry, respectively. During the Kofun period, it is said that migrant groups from China came to Japan and settled on the island, bringing with them various cultural advances and centralized leadership. The migrants who came to Japan during the Kofun period appear to have had ancestry that mainly resembles the ancestry of the Han Chinese population of China. The Jomon people were hunter-gathers; the Yayoi people introduced rice cultivation; and the Kofun migrants introduced imperial state formation.</li>

            <li>Shinto is an ethnic religion focusing on ceremonies and rituals. In Shinto, followers believe that kami – Shinto deities or spirits – are present throughout nature, including rocks, trees, and mountains. Humans can also be considered to possess a kami. One of the goals of Shinto is to maintain or strengthen the connection between humans, nature, and kami. The religion developed in Japan prior to the 6th century CE, after which point followers built shrines to worship kami.</li>
            <li>Buddhism developed in India around the 6th and 4th centuries BCE and eventually spread through China and Korea. It arrived in Japan during the 6th century CE, where it was initially unpopular. Most Japanese people were unable to understand the difficult philosophical messages present in Buddhism; however, an appreciation for the religion's art is believed to have led to Buddhism later growing in popularity.</li>

           The Japanese "national character" has been written about under the term Nihonjinron, literally meaning "theories/discussions about the Japanese people" and referring to texts on matters that are normally the concerns of sociology, psychology, history, linguistics, and philosophy, but emphasizing the authors' assumptions or perceptions of Japanese exceptionalism; these are predominantly written in Japan by Japanese people,though noted examples have also been written by foreign residents, journalists and even scholars.
